# Metroid-fan-page


## Description

-A fan page for the popular video game, Metroid

- I took this project on to learn how to build a website from scratch. I have learned about flexbox, media queries, and reactive websites, and used this project as a way to tie all of those concepts together. 
- This page contains links to various websites regarding the popular video game franchise, Metroid. The user is able to shrink the page to any size and have the site react accordingly to make sure the content is still organized and readable. 
- I learned many things on this project: How to more effectively research topics related to programming, how to collaborate with others on a project (credit to Josh Hooper, my mentor helping me refactor some code and teach me more about flexbox), the relationship with parent-child elements in regard to flexbox, media queries, organization of code structure and how that relates to css being able to manipulate the HTML, and how to make a hover effect using a media query.
