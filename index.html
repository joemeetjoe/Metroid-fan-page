                Metroid. A video game so popular it birthed its own genre. A pioneer for the representation of women in the video game space. You play as Samus Aran, a bounty hunter adventuring across the galaxy in her pursuit to stop the space pirates and their machinations. In your exploration, you will discover countless planets filled with danger and mystery. Alone and armed with your Chozo-battle-suit,  you will gather power ups, unlock secrets, and race to stop the leader of the space pirates-mother brain. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metroid has spawned an entire genre of video games, the "metroidvania." Characterized by an open world with locked sections only traversed by discovering new abilities, the Metroid franchise has become loved by speedrunners everywhere.
